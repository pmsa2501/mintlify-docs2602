# Authentication & Login: User Guide

---

## Part 1: Feature Overview

### What is Authentication?

Authentication is how you securely sign in to MAM360. The system verifies your identity before allowing access to truck management features. You can log in using your Google account or an email code.

### Understanding Your Role

MAM360 has three user roles that determine what you can do:

#### Administrator

- Full access to all features
- Can manage trucks at all stages
- Can modify any truck status

#### Operator

- Full access to all features
- Same permissions as Administrator
- Typically port staff who manage daily operations

#### Client

- Can view your company's trucks
- Can create new truck entries (Estado 0-1)
- Cannot use PRC operations
- Cannot modify trucks after they enter the queue (Estado 2+)

Your role is assigned by the system administrator.

## Part 3: Reference

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What if I forgot my Google password?

Use Google's password recovery at accounts.google.com. MAM360 uses your Google account, so Google manages your password.

#### What if I don't receive the email code?

1. Check your spam/junk folder
2. Wait 2 minutes - sometimes email is delayed
3. Click "Resend Code" (Reenviar codigo)
4. Make sure you entered the correct email address

#### Can I use any email address?

Yes, any valid email address works. You don't need a Google account to use email sign-in.

#### Why can't I access certain features?

Your access depends on your role. Clients cannot access PRC operations or modify trucks in Estado 2 or higher. Contact your administrator if you need additional access.

#### How do I change my phone number?

Currently, phone numbers can only be changed through the setup process. Contact your administrator for assistance.

#### Is my information secure?

Yes. MAM360 uses industry-standard security:

- Encrypted connections (HTTPS)
- Secure session management
- Role-based access control
- Your data is only accessible to you and authorized administrators

### Troubleshooting

#### "Session expired" error

Your session timed out. Simply log in again.

#### "Access denied" error

You tried to use a feature not available to your role. This is normal - different roles have different permissions.

#### Can't receive email codes

1. Check spam folder
2. Wait 5 minutes and try again
3. Contact your administrator

#### Page won't load after login

1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try a different browser
3. Contact technical support

### Important Notes

- Always sign out when using shared computers
- Keep your Google account secure with a strong password
- If you suspect unauthorized access to your account, contact your administrator immediately
- Your role determines what features you can use - this is by design to protect port operations
