# Part 1: Feature Overview

### What is Authentication?

Authentication is how you securely sign in to MAM360. The system verifies your identity before allowing access to truck management features. You can log in using your Google account or an email code.

### Understanding Your Role

MAM360 has three user roles that determine what you can do:

#### Administrator

- Full access to all features
- Can manage trucks at all stages
- Can modify any truck status

#### Operator

- Full access to all features
- Same permissions as Administrator
- Typically port staff who manage daily operations

#### Client

- Can view your company's trucks
- Can create new truck entries (Estado 0-1)
- Cannot use PRC operations
- Cannot modify trucks after they enter the queue (Estado 2+)

Your role is assigned by the system administrator.
